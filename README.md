# Comp Graphic and Visualization

Designing Software:

I approach designing software by first understanding the requirements and goals of the project, and then identifying the best design patterns and architecture to achieve them.
Throughout the project, I gained skills in designing classes, using enums, and applying design patterns such as the Observer pattern.
Design Process:

For this project, I followed an iterative design process. I first created a basic prototype, tested it, and then added new features as I went along.
I also made use of version control (Git) to track changes and collaborate with other team members.
Development Strategies:

While working on the 3D scene, I used several new development strategies such as object-oriented programming, 3D graphics programming, and shader programming.
I also made use of existing libraries such as OpenGL and GLSL to simplify the development process.
Iteration:

Iteration played a significant role in my development process. I constantly tested my code and modified it to meet the changing requirements of the project.
This approach helped me to identify and fix errors early on in the development process.
Evolution of Code Development:

Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code evolved from a focus on functionality to a focus on optimizing performance and improving the user experience.
I also became more comfortable working with complex data structures and learned how to use them effectively in my code.
Computer Science:

Computer science can help me reach my goals by providing a foundation in software development and problem-solving skills that can be applied in many different fields.
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me new knowledge and skills in 3D programming, which can be applied in game development, scientific visualization, and other fields.
Application of Skills:

The skills I have learned in computational graphics and visualizations can be applied in my future educational pathway by allowing me to take more advanced computer science courses and explore more advanced topics such as virtual and augmented reality.
In my future professional pathway, I can apply my knowledge of 3D programming to game development, architectural visualization, and scientific modeling.
